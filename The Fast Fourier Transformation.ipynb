    "# What is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that efficiently computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal or sequence. Fourier analysis, in general, converts a signal from its base or original domain to the frequency domain and the DFT algorithm does this for a discrete signal or sequence on the infinite domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "What truly makes FFT a tremendously better than the plain vanilla implementation of DFT is that the asymptotic complexity of the transform is $O(nlog(n))$ vs. $O(n^2)$ of the DFT. This means that for sufficiently large inputs, say the cardinality of which is $n=10^{10}$, the FFT algorithm will have $10^{10} \\times log_{10}(10^{10}) \\approx 3.34 \\times 10^{11}$ operations vs. $10^{10 \\times 2} = 10^{20}$ operations. That's a significant computation improvement and therefore, has made it feasible to scale to large data sets.\n"

    "2. We can further improve this algorithm by including vectorization, but, I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader as that implementation does break the beauty of a simple DAC algorithm.\n",

    "1. The ``small`` step here is the check to see if the size of the input is <= 32.\n",
    "2. The ``Solution`` step is the naive DFT algorithm.\n",
    "3. The ``divide`` step is implicit in the recursion on the divided odd and even indices.\n",
    "4. The ``DAC`` step is the FFT algorithm recursively called on the divided odd and even indicies.\n",
    "5. The ``combine`` step is the ``np.concatenate`` on the Fourier Transforms for the even + factor * odd components for [0:N//2] and [N//2:] respectively. These represent the combination of the split up chunks for the N cardinality at each step."

    "1. __Fourier Series__: Allow us to approximate any __periodic__ and __piece-wise smooth__ function via in infinite sum of increasing sin and cosine functions.\n",
    "2. __Fourier Transforms__: Takes the idea of Fourier Series and allows us to approximate a function as in infinite sum of increasing sin and cosine functions on an infinite domain where the functions to be represented don't necessarily have to be periodic.\n",
    "3. __Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT)__: The input to this algorithm is a discrete data vector that is then converted into it's Fourier Representation and the output is a vector of coefficient of the corresponding frequencies. The plain vanilla implementation of this transform is a matrix-vector multiplication of a matrix of fundamental frequencies and the input data vector, respectively. Naively, the asymptotic complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "4. __Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)__: A more computationally efficient algorithm to compute the DFT. The asymptotic complexity of this algorithm is $O(nlog(n))$. The premise behind the algorithm is to use the divide-and-conquer technique on the odd and even components of the other-wise large matrix-vector multiplication."
